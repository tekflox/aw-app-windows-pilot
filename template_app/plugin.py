Entrypoint referenced by aw-app.json's runtime.entrypoint
("template_app.plugin:TemplateAppPlugin").

Plugs into the real F4 framework runtime: activate(ctx) (1) installs each
declared system CLI THROUGH the gated ``ctx.commands`` facade (capability
``commands:install``), so every install is journaled and the framework
reverts them on uninstall by replaying the journal (running
scripts/uninstall.sh once), and (2) registers the backend sub-app from
``routes.py`` THROUGH the gated ``ctx.routes`` facade (capability
``routes:register`` — ADR Decision 2/6, docs/knowledge_base/docs/
architecture/adr-app-front-back-routes-dual-mode.md), mounted by the
runtime at ``/api/apps/aw-app-template``. The install scripts are idempotent, so the
reconciler safely re-runs activate on every boot / workspace recreation.

TEMPLATE: this is the whole pattern every aw-app-* Tier-1 app uses — copy
it as-is (just rename the class/module) unless your app needs something
`contributes.system_clis`/`contributes.routes` can't express (a background
service or a frontend nav entry — see aw-app-presentations, aw-app-
whiteboard for those patterns instead).

This template ships a real `config_schema` (the `greeting` knob) but
`config_visible: false` in aw-app.json keeps it OFF the Settings gear/entry —
not every app has user-facing settings (most Runnables-style apps don't),
but a manifest can still keep a `config_schema` purely for internal use
(read here via `ctx.config`, editable only through `POST /api/apps/<id>/config`
directly, not the UI). Delete `config_schema`/`config_visible` entirely if
you don't need config at all; flip `config_visible` to true (or remove it —
it defaults true) if you want it user-facing — see aw-app-git's manifest +
plugin.py for a real example with a settings panel window.
